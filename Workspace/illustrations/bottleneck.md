dev -> build : Trigger Image Build
build -> local_img : Generate Image (~3.3 GB)
local_img -> wifi : Upload Image (~4 min)
wifi -> remote_img : Store Image on Rhodey
dev -> prov_script : Launch Provisioning Script
prov_script --> libvirt : SSH Connection
libvirt -> remote_img : Use Uploaded Image
libvirt -> vms : Create VMs from Image

note over wifi : Bottleneck:\nSlow upload (3.3GB @ 15MB/s â‰ˆ 4 min per iteration)
