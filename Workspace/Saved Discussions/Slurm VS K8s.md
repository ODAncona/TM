Slurm and Kubernetes have fundamentally different scheduling paradigms due to their intended use cases:

- **Slurm** is designed for **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** environments where workloads are typically **batch jobs** that require exclusive resource allocation for a specified duration.
- **Kubernetes** is designed for **cloud-native applications** that run **long-lived services** and microservices, often scaling dynamically.

### **Key Differences in Scheduling Paradigms**

|Feature|Slurm (HPC Scheduler)|Kubernetes (Container Orchestrator)|
|---|---|---|
|**Resource Model**|Nodes are treated as **homogeneous resources** (CPU cores, memory, GPUs).|Nodes run **diverse workloads**, often in shared environments.|
|**Job Execution**|Jobs are submitted, **queued**, and run when resources become available.|Pods are scheduled **immediately** if resources exist.|
|**Preemption**|Jobs can be **preempted** based on priority, usually stopping lower-priority jobs.|Kubernetes can preempt pods if using a priority class, but it’s not the default.|
|**Job Lifetime**|Jobs run for a **fixed duration** and **exit when complete**.|Pods/services are usually **long-lived** unless manually terminated.|
|**Scaling**|Nodes are statically assigned and jobs run on them until completion.|Kubernetes dynamically scales workloads and nodes (auto-scaling).|
|**Job Dependencies**|Supports job **dependencies**, where one job starts only after another completes.|Kubernetes supports **dependencies**, but primarily for service orchestration (e.g., InitContainers, readiness probes).|
|**Resource Guarantees**|Jobs request **fixed** amounts of CPU, memory, etc.|Kubernetes **dynamically allocates** resources based on requests/limits.|

### **Implications of These Differences**

1. **Slurm prioritizes optimal resource usage for parallel computing.**
    - Jobs are scheduled to make the most of CPU, memory, and GPU resources for scientific simulations, AI training, etc.
    - Nodes can remain idle if no jobs fit perfectly.
2. **Kubernetes prioritizes service availability and elasticity.**
    - Resources are **shared**, allowing multiple lightweight workloads on the same node.
    - It emphasizes availability, self-healing, and **auto-scaling** of workloads based on demand.

### **Why This Matters for Running Kubernetes on Slurm**

- Kubernetes expects **persistent worker nodes**, but in Slurm, jobs (which can be entire Kubernetes clusters) are time-limited.
- Slurm expects **batch execution**, but Kubernetes assumes workloads can be distributed dynamically across long-running nodes.
- Slurm queues jobs when resources aren’t available, while Kubernetes expects nodes to scale automatically.
