**Kubernetes Unique Hostname Join Problem**

The provisioning workflow for Kubernetes clusters involves distinct phases: build time and provision time. During build time, the operating system, network, and DNS configurations are established, and certificates for Kubernetes components are generated. Both master and worker node images are configured with these settings. At provision time, the master node is deployed first, generating a secret used for secure communication within the cluster. Worker nodes are subsequently provisioned, joining the cluster using this secret to authenticate their membership. However, a critical issue arises with the static VM images used for worker nodes. These images, created during the build phase, have a fixed hostname embedded within them, such as 'k8s-worker'. When multiple worker nodes are provisioned from the same static image, they inherit this identical hostname, leading to conflicts within Kubernetes. Kubernetes mandates unique hostnames for each node to ensure proper identification and management. Consequently, while the first worker node with a given hostname can successfully join the cluster, additional nodes with the same hostname are rejected, preventing them from joining. This limitation severely impacts scalability and operational functionality, as Kubernetes cannot differentiate between nodes with identical hostnames. To resolve this issue, a dynamic mechanism for hostname configuration is required, enabling each worker node to receive a unique identifier at provision time without relying on static image settings. This adjustment would allow all nodes to join the Kubernetes cluster successfully, enhancing scalability and ensuring robust cluster operations.
