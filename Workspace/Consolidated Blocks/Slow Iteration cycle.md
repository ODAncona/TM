Here's a concise, clear, and well-structured paragraph explaining your problem, suitable for inclusion in your documentation or report:

The current iteration cycle for testing new configurations is significantly slowed down by the existing provisioning workflow. Specifically, each configuration change requires rebuilding the VM images locally on the orchestration machine (X1-Carbon laptop), uploading these large images over the network to the remote compute server (Rhodey), and then fully decommissioning and recommissioning the virtual cluster. This process is time-intensive, severely limiting rapid experimentation and development. Additionally, there is a practical issue with Kubernetes node provisioning: worker nodes currently share an identical hostname derived from the static image configuration, causing conflicts within Kubernetes, which expects unique hostnames for each node. To resolve this, hostnames need to be dynamically injected or configured at provisioning time. However, incorporating this dynamic configuration step into the current static image build process exacerbates the iteration bottleneck described above. Therefore, a solution is required that allows quick and flexible injection of dynamic parameters—such as hostnames—without necessitating a full rebuild and re-upload of VM images, thus significantly reducing iteration latency and enabling more agile experimentation.

Here's a detailed, well-structured explanation of your problem formatted as a LaTeX paragraph:


The current provisioning workflow introduces a significant bottleneck in the iteration cycle, severely hindering rapid experimentation and development. Specifically, every configuration change requires rebuilding the virtual machine (VM) images locally on the orchestration machine (X1-Carbon laptop), transferring these large images over the network to the remote compute server (Rhodey), and then fully decommissioning and recommissioning the virtual cluster. This multi-step process is time-consuming and inefficient, as image builds and network uploads can take considerable time, especially when frequently iterating on configurations. Furthermore, an additional practical challenge arises from the static nature of hostnames embedded within the VM images. Currently, all worker nodes inherit identical hostnames from the static image configuration, which conflicts with Kubernetes' requirement for uniquely identifiable hostnames across nodes. Kubernetes relies on unique hostnames to manage and differentiate nodes effectively; identical hostnames prevent nodes from joining the cluster properly and cause operational conflicts. To address this issue, hostnames must be dynamically injected or configured at provisioning time. However, integrating dynamic hostname assignment into the current static image build process exacerbates the existing iteration bottleneck. Thus, there is a pressing need for an improved provisioning approach that separates static and dynamic configurations, allowing parameters such as hostnames to be quickly and flexibly injected at runtime without necessitating a complete rebuild and re-upload of VM images. This would significantly reduce iteration latency, streamline the development workflow, and enable more agile experimentation.

Here's a carefully revised LaTeX paragraph that clearly describes your workflow, highlights the specific bottlenecks, and provides concrete details to make the explanation compelling and understandable even for an expert unfamiliar with your exact setup:


The current workflow for provisioning and testing new virtual machine (VM) configurations introduces a significant bottleneck, severely limiting rapid development and experimentation. Specifically, each iteration involves several time-consuming steps: first, the orchestration machine (an X1-Carbon laptop) locally builds a complete VM image from scratch using Nix flakes, a process which typically takes around 3 minutes per image. Each resulting image is approximately 3.3 GB in size. Subsequently, this large image must be uploaded from the orchestration laptop to the remote compute server (Rhodey) over a WiFi connection that provides a limited bandwidth of approximately 15 MB/s. This network transfer alone can take several minutes per iteration, further exacerbating the delay. Once uploaded, the previous virtual cluster configuration on Rhodey must be entirely decommissioned, meaning all existing VMs are destroyed, and storage resources are cleaned up. Only after this teardown can the new cluster be provisioned and configured using the updated image. Additionally, this static image-building approach introduces another practical complication: all worker nodes currently share the same hostname embedded in the base image configuration. Kubernetes, the scheduler used in this scenario, strictly requires unique hostnames for each node to correctly identify and manage cluster members. The presence of identical hostnames prevents new worker nodes from properly joining the Kubernetes cluster, causing operational conflicts and failures. Resolving this issue necessitates dynamically injecting unique hostnames into each VM at provisioning time, but integrating such dynamic parameters into the current static image build workflow further compounds the iteration latency problem. Consequently, there is a pressing need for an improved provisioning strategy that clearly separates static image components from dynamic runtime configuration, allowing parameters such as hostnames to be quickly and flexibly injected at runtime without necessitating a full image rebuild and re-upload. Achieving this would significantly reduce iteration latency, streamline the overall development workflow, and enable more agile and efficient experimentation.
