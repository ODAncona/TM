Exactly what Question you want to target:

- Metric optimization
- Improve resource utilization
- What system for which usage

1. We want to make a case for disaggregated computing (simple simulator, show we can can get benefit)
2. We want disaggregated to be real, use real software and show that we can make it real. Feasible technically with hardware and have system ready
3. Mix of the two. If you use flux you can get that improvement.

What are the challenge of disaggregated computing.

3-4 question what I want to find an answer for.
