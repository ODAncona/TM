In the context of my master thesis, I need to solve Online Distributed Bipartite Matching problem for disaggregated computing. The problem is well studied, and I want to write a thesis that summarize the state of the art and answer the question: Which System for which usage ? To do so, I want to run benchmarks with different scheduler // solutions and optimize different metrics such as fairness, throughput, resource utilization and compiles them in a Pareto graph. However, in order to build such a graph I need a various set of workload that are memory, CPU, network, GPU or other intensive, that arrives progressively. I will test each scheduler and save the results. This is very important, that the scheduler handles disaggregated computing.

At this point of my research, I try to identify what scheduler already exists for supercomputers and disaggregated computing to establish a baseline or even search for a solution that already solve the problem at hand.

List me all OpenSource scheduler that can handle heterogeneous jobs (jobs with different CPU, GPU, FPGA, memory, and network requirements) and heterogeneous accelerators (GPUs, TPUs, FPGAs, AI accelerators, etc.).
