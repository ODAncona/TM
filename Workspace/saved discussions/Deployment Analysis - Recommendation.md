# HPC Scheduler Benchmarking Infrastructure Recommendation

Based on your architecture and project requirements, I'll recommend a provisioning stack that would work well with your Hydra configuration generator.

## Understanding Your Requirements

You need to:
- Test different cluster topologies (A) with different schedulers (B)
- Generate many configurations systematically
- Automate the full deployment pipeline
- Work within constraints (no sudo access on Rhodey)

## Recommended Approach

I recommend using **Terraform + Ansible + Libvirt** as your core provisioning stack, working with Hydra as your configuration generator:

### 1. Hydra for Configuration Generation
- Use Hydra to generate all your experimental configurations
- Define parameters for VM topology, scheduler type, resource allocations
- Output structured configs that feed into your provisioning tools

### 2. Terraform with Libvirt Provider
- Handles VM provisioning (step 1)
- Works well for local virtualization on a single node
- Declarative approach means reproducible infrastructure
- The `terraform-provider-libvirt` is designed for this exact use case

### 3. Ansible for Configuration
- Handles OS setup, package installation and configuration (steps 2-4)
- Excellent for configuring each scheduler (SLURM, K8s, Flux)
- Works well for template-based configuration files
- Has modules for all the schedulers you're testing

### Workflow

```
Hydra (generates configs)
  │
  ▼
Terraform (provisions VMs using libvirt)
  │
  ▼
Ansible (configures schedulers & software)
  │
  ▼
Metrics Collection (Prometheus, Grafana, MLflow)
```

## Why Not the Alternatives?

- **Cloud-init**: Useful but limited for complex scheduler configurations + It was designed for large-scale cloud provisioning, not for single VM setups.
- **Nix**: Powerful but has a steep learning curve; more suitable when reproducibility at the package level is critical


## Implementation Notes

1. Create a Hydra config structure that parameterizes:
   - Number of VMs per cluster
   - Resource allocation (CPU, RAM)
   - Scheduler type and version
   - Network topology

2. Output Terraform variable files from Hydra

3. Create Terraform modules for each cluster type that:
   - Define VM resources with libvirt
   - Configure networks
   - Output connection information for Ansible

4. Create Ansible roles for:
   - Base system configuration
   - SLURM installation and configuration
   - Kubernetes installation and configuration
   - Flux installation and configuration

This approach gives you a flexible, reproducible system to explore your parameter space systematically and collect meaningful benchmark data.
