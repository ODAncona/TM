For a more realistic virtual cluster involving multiple virtual machines, NixOps, Nix's official deployment tool, offers a scalable solution using backends like libvirt. This approach mirrors physical distributed setups, suitable for testing distributed scenarios or preparing for production-like environments.

- **Setup Process:** First, install NixOps. Create a deployment file defining multiple NixOS machines with the libvirt backend, specifying VM settings like memory and CPU. Each machine's configuration.nix should include Kubernetes configurations from the [NixOS Wiki on Kubernetes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Kubernetes).
- **Configuration Details:** For the master, enable services.kubernetes with roles ["master" "node"], setting masterAddress, apiserverAddress, and easyCerts = true. For nodes, use roles ["node"] with similar settings, ensuring masterAddress references the master's IP, defined in the deployment file. The Wiki, tested on NixOS 20.09, includes caveats like disabling firewalls if needed and setting docker0 in promiscuous mode.
- **Deployment and Joining:** Deploy with nixops create and nixops deploy. Post-deployment, retrieve the join token from the master (e.g., cat /var/lib/kubernetes/secrets/apitoken.secret) and manually join nodes using echo TOKEN | nixos-kubernetes-node-join, checking status with kubectl get nodes.
- **Considerations:** This method requires familiarity with NixOps and libvirt, and joining nodes manually may introduce complexity. Automation could be explored, but current guidance suggests manual steps for simplicity.

This approach is more involved but provides a realistic cluster, aligning with the user's potential need for distributed testing, especially given NixOps's support for network and cloud deployments.
