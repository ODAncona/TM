With this specification I need to evaluate what approach I will use between VM or LXC/LXD. Approach 1 (bare metal) is not possible because I only have 1 machine. I need to simulate the cluster. Therefore, I need an analysis to help me decide between LXC/LXD or VM. I fear LXC/LXD share the host's kernel and therefore are subject to the scheduler of the host's OS. However, with VMs they have their own kernel which could solve the problem. I need to identify what would be the limitations and boundary of my simulation over the machine. My supervisor suspect that it's ok if VM use KVM that has a shared kernel with the Host's system because they have their own time. What do you think? If VM via KVM shares the system host, I don't have reason to use VMs and LXC containers should be more than enough.

# Analysis of LXC/LXD vs. VM for HPC Scheduler Benchmarking

## Key Differences Between LXC/LXD and VMs

You've raised an important question about the simulation environment for your HPC scheduler benchmark. Let me clarify some fundamental differences:

### LXC/LXD Containers

- **Kernel Sharing**: LXC/LXD containers share the host kernel, but they have isolated userspace environments
- **Resource Management**: While containers have their own cgroups for resource isolation, they ultimately rely on the host's scheduler for CPU time allocation
- **Performance**: Lower overhead (near-native performance)
- **Isolation**: Less complete isolation than VMs

### KVM Virtual Machines

- **Kernel Independence**: KVM VMs run their own kernel, not the host's kernel
- **Resource Management**: VMs have dedicated virtual CPUs that are scheduled by the host, but internally they manage their own scheduling independently
- **Performance**: Higher overhead than containers, but still good with hardware virtualization support
- **Isolation**: Stronger isolation than containers

## Impact on Scheduler Benchmarking

For your specific use case of benchmarking HPC schedulers:

### Critical Consideration: Scheduler Independence

The most important factor is whether the test environment allows the HPC scheduler (SLURM, Kubernetes+Volcano, Flux) to make scheduling decisions independently of the host system's scheduler.

VMs provide this independence because:

1. Each VM has its own kernel and scheduler
2. The host KVM scheduler allocates CPU time to the VM as a whole, but within the VM, the guest OS makes its own scheduling decisions
3. This creates a clearer boundary between host scheduling and the HPC scheduler you're testing

LXC/LXD containers may introduce interference because:

1. All container processes are ultimately scheduled by the host kernel
2. The host's scheduler decisions could impact or mask the behavior of your HPC scheduler
3. Resource contention on the host could affect measurements in ways that don't reflect real HPC environments

## Recommendation

**Use KVM virtual machines** for your benchmark environment for these reasons:

1. **Scheduler Independence**: VMs provide a more accurate representation of how schedulers would behave on separate physical machines
2. **Isolation**: Better isolation prevents the host scheduler from interfering with your measurements
3. **Realistic Simulation**: VMs better simulate a true cluster environment where each node has its own kernel and scheduler
4. **Consistent Measurement**: Results will be less affected by host scheduling decisions

Your supervisor is correct that KVM VMs have their own time accounting and scheduling, even though KVM itself is a kernel module in the host. This independence is crucial for your benchmarking scenario.

## Implementation Considerations

If you proceed with VMs:

- Use CPU pinning to ensure VM vCPUs map consistently to physical cores
- Consider NUMA topology awareness in your VM configuration
- Ensure consistent memory allocation across test scenarios
- Monitor host system load to detect any interference in your measurements

The slight performance overhead of VMs is an acceptable trade-off for the increased accuracy in measuring the behavior of different HPC schedulers.
