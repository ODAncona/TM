I have a question about VMs Is it possible to install a basic image of any OS, and then store it but provision it with a different configuration ? Like more RAM, more CPU ? I'm not sure if the .img contains only the filesystem written on disk or as well the provisioning configuration. It would be helpful because I try to generate an image automatically with everything installed on it but I'm not able to boot with it.

âœ… **Short answer:**  
Yes â€” the `.img` file contains only the **OS disk content** (filesystem, bootloader, partitions).

It does **not** store or lock in:

- CPU count,
- RAM size,
- network devices,
- virtual hardware settings.
    

Those are always configured **by the hypervisor** (Libvirt, QEMU, Proxmox, etc.) when you define or launch the VM.

---

ðŸ’¡ **Think of it like this:**

|.img file|VM configuration (Libvirt / QEMU / Cloud)|
|---|---|
|OS filesystem and bootloader|Virtual hardware: RAM, CPUs, network, etc|

You can install NixOS (or any Linux) once into an image, save that `.img`, and reuse it many times, each time with **different virtual machine specs** â€” like changing CPUs, RAM, network cards â€” even boot options â€” all without modifying the image.

### ðŸ’» **Example with `virt-install`:**

Once you upload your `nixos.img` to `rhodey`, you can spin up a VM with whatever resources you want:

```bash
virt-install \
 --name nixos-test \
 --memory 4096 \
 --vcpus 2 \
 --disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/images/nixos.img,format=qcow2 \
 --os-variant generic \
 --import \
 --network network=default \
 --noautoconsole
```

- `--memory 4096` â†’ 4 GB RAM.
- `--vcpus 2` â†’ 2 cores.
- `--disk` â†’ uses your prebuilt `.img` file.
- `--import` â†’ skip install, boot directly from existing image.
    

You can later **delete and redefine** the VM with more or less RAM/CPUs anytime â€” the `.img` doesnâ€™t change.

---

ðŸ’¡ **But**:  
For this to work, the image must:

- have the bootloader installed properly (GRUB, systemd-boot),
- and the OS must be generic enough (like using `virtio` drivers, DHCP, etc.) so it can run on any virtual machine config.
    

---

ðŸ’¡ **Summary:**

- The `.img` is just the virtual "hard disk."
- The hardware like CPUs, RAM, network are provided at boot time by Libvirt/QEMU.
- You can absolutely bake a generic NixOS image and re-use it flexibly across many VM setups!

ðŸ‘‰ If your `nixos.img` isnâ€™t booting, I bet itâ€™s because the **image lacks a bootloader** (like in your earlier example with `nixos-generate -f qcow`).

If you want, I can help you make a bootable one (`vm-nogui` format) or help you write a `virt-install` command for the image you have.

Want me to help you with that?

## Boot problem

ðŸ§  Why the previous image failed:
When you used nixos-generate -f qcow before with a config that didn't specify a bootloader, you got a "blank" root filesystem. But now â€” with your posted config â€” the generated .qcow2 image is absolutely ready for:

```bash
virt-install --name nixos-test --memory 4096 --vcpus 2 \
  --disk path=/home/odancona/.local/share/libvirt/images/nixos.img,format=qcow2 \
  --os-variant generic --import \
  --network network=scheduler_benchmark_net --noautoconsole
```
âœ… It should boot and work!
If it still hangs, Iâ€™d check:

Make sure you are using UEFI boot if the VM is expecting EFI (since systemd-boot is used) â€” or:

Adjust your config to use GRUB for BIOS mode.
